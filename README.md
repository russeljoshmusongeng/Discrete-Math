# Odd-Indexed Insertion Sort (Python)

This project implements a **modified Insertion Sort algorithm** where only the elements at **odd indices** are used as keys during sorting. The program is written in **Python** and accepts **any user input**, making it a **general algorithm implementation**.

## Project Description

In this version of Insertion Sort:

- Only elements at **odd indices (1, 3, 5, …)** are considered as **keys**.
- Sorting is done in **ascending order**.
- Elements at **even indices remain in their original positions** unless affected by a shift.
- The program also **counts the total number of shifts** made during sorting.
- The program works for **any input provided by the user**, not just a fixed sample.
